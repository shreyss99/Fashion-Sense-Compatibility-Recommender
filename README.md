## Introduction

A fashion recommendation system that delivers customized suggestions based on user input by combining the power of transfer learning with the ResNet50 architecture and Annoy, an enhanced K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. I successfully analyzed the image data by using transfer learning with ResNet-50 to perform feature extraction on a sizable dataset of more than 45,000 images. Using K-Nearest Neighbors, I implemented a similarity search approach to find the top 5 closest matches to a user's input, thereby offering personalized fashion recommendations. The system is easy to use and intuitive, making it possible to analyze image data accurately and successfully.

This recommendation system showcases the versatility and power of transfer learning, similarity search, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## Recommendation Engine:Proposed Methodology 

In this project, we present a model that combines the Nearest Neighbor backed recommender with Convolutional Neural Network. According to the figure After training the neural networks, an inventory is chosen to generate recommendations, and a database is made for the inventory items. Based on the input image, the nearest neighbor's algorithm locates the most pertinent products and generates recommendations.
